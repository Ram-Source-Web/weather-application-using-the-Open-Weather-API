# Weather App

## Overview
The Weather App is a simple web application that allows users to get real-time weather information for any city. The application uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data and displays it in a user-friendly interface.

## Features
- Fetches and displays current weather data for any city.
- Provides details like temperature, weather condition, humidity, pressure, and wind speed.
- Dynamically updates the background image based on the weather condition.
- User-friendly interface with responsive design.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- OpenWeatherMap API

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
- Internet connection to fetch weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository or download the ZIP file.
2. Extract the files to your desired location.

### Setup
1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. Ensure you have a valid OpenWeatherMap API key. Replace the placeholder API key in the `script.js` file with your own API key.

```javascript
// script.js
const weatherApi = {
    key: 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE',
    baseUrl: 'https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather'
}
Usage
Open index.html in a web browser.
Enter the name of a city in the search input box.
Press Enter to fetch and display the weather information for the entered city.

# Weather App

## Overview
The Weather App is a simple web application that allows users to get real-time weather information for any city. The application uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data and displays it in a user-friendly interface.

## Features
- Fetches and displays current weather data for any city.
- Provides details like temperature, weather condition, humidity, pressure, and wind speed.
- Dynamically updates the background image based on the weather condition.
- User-friendly interface with responsive design.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: For the structure of the web page.
- **CSS**: For styling the web page.
- **JavaScript**: For the functionality and interaction of the web page.
- **OpenWeatherMap API**: For fetching weather data.

## Approach
The application is designed to be simple and intuitive. It includes an input field where users can enter the name of a city. Upon pressing the Enter key, a request is sent to the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch the current weather data for that city. The fetched data is then displayed on the page, and the background image changes dynamically based on the weather condition.

## Running the Application Locally

### Prerequisites
- A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
- Internet connection to fetch weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository or download the ZIP file.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/weather-app.git
Extract the files to your desired location if you downloaded the ZIP file.
Setup
Open index.html in a text editor and ensure you have a valid OpenWeatherMap API key.
Replace the placeholder API key in the script.js file with your own API key.
javascript
Copy code
// script.js
const weatherApi = {
    key: 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE',
    baseUrl: 'https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather'
}
Running the Application
Open index.html in a web browser.
Enter the name of a city in the search input box.
Press Enter to fetch and display the weather information for the entered city.
File Structure
index.html - The main HTML file containing the structure of the application.
style.css - The CSS file for styling the application.
script.js - The JavaScript file containing the logic for fetching and displaying weather data.
Known Issues or Limitations
Accuracy of Weather Data: The accuracy of the weather data depends on the OpenWeatherMap API. Occasionally, there may be discrepancies.
Limited API Calls: The free tier of the OpenWeatherMap API has a limit on the number of API calls per minute. Exceeding this limit may result in errors.
Browser Compatibility: While the application should work on all modern browsers, there might be minor styling issues on older browser versions.
